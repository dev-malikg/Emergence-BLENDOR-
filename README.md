## Challenges Faced

*   Learning how to position the light to create dramatic shadows.
*   Experimenting with different materials to achieve the desired silhouette effect.

## What I Learned

*   Basic modeling techniques.
*   The importance of lighting in creating mood and atmosphere.
*   Basic rendering settings.

## Future Improvements

*   Adding more detail to the background.
*   Experimenting with different lighting setups.
